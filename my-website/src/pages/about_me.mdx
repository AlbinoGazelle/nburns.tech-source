# Hey! 
My name's Nathan Burns! I'm a student at Western Washington University currently studying Cybersecurity. In my free time, I help manage the <a href="https://wwucyber.com"> Cybersecurity Club</a> at WWU, working to increase cybersecurity awareness around campus by giving talks on recent cybersecurity news, inviting guest speakers, and helping to present technical topics to a non-technical audience. 

I like to consider myself a member of the purple team, interested in both offense and defense in Cybersecurity. I find technologies like YARA, eBPF, SIGMA, and Zeek fascinating. My dream job is to become a Detection Engineer, creating rules to detect threats before they can cause damage to an organization. While I'm still learning, you can see my progress by checking out my [Yara](https://github.com/AlbinoGazelle/YARA) and [SIGMA](https://github.com/AlbinoGazelle/SIGMA) rule repositories and by checking out my ongoing Threat Hunting (Coming Soon) series. 


As you can see below, outside of the office, I love to go hiking and kayaking in the North Cascades, my favorite destination being Diablo Lake. I also love reading (check out my reading list [here](/blog/reading_list)) and cooking in my free time. 

You can find my current resume [here](/resume.pdf) and if you have any questions or want to connect with me, please don't hesitate to [contact me](/contact).   
Thank you so much for visiting and taking the time to learn more about me!   
Sincerely,  
Nathan Burns
