## Walkthrough

I want to preface this walkthrough by saying the way I solved this was *not* the intended solution.  

For this challenge we're only given an attachment and a vague description so I did what most people would do when given a malicious binary, I ran it (in a virtualized environment of course). To track what it does I downloaded sysmon and installed SwiftOnSecurity's config file (my [Introductory Malware Analysis](/blog/malware_analysis_lab) blog post has instructions on how to do this), after installation I simply ran the binary.  
Upon running the binary we get what looks to be a python console with this message:

### Sysmon Logs
Lets see what sysmon picked up:

Here we can see brain-melt.exe starting, nothing interesting so far.  

### Flag

Bingo! Here's the flag! That was easy. This is something I do often when analyzing windows binaries for challenges (or for fun). You'd be surprised on what you can find when analyzing stuff like this.

Thanks for reading! Special thanks to the authors of this challenge, NightWolf and M_alpha. If you have any feedback on this post or my website, please don't hesitate to [contact me.](/contact)
