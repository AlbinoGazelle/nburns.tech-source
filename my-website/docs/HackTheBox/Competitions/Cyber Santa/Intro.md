# Thoughts
I was severely time constrained during this CTF and wasn't able to dedicate as much time as I wanted. It unfortunately ran through finals week, leaving me with only a couple hours to work on this specific CTF. The challenges were also unexpectedly difficult, both challenges requiring considerable time to finish, specifically with Toy Workshop I overlooked some beginner enumeration and incorrectly assumed a firewall was protecting the web service. During this CTF I learned to use ngrok as a tunnel for sending cookies with an XSS payload to an external server and a significant amount on XSS attacks.
