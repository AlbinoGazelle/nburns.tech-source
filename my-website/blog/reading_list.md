Here's a list of what i'm currently reading or books I plan on reading in the future.

Make sure to keep an eye on my [blog](/blog) for reviews for these books once I finish them.

### Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems by Ross Anderson
I'm about halfway through this book and it's already changed how I look at systems and system security. Absolutely amazing and a required read for any security professional, no matter the field.

### Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir
Looking to branch into Sci-Fi more and this was recommended to me by a friend.

### Hyperion by Dan Simmons
Finished reading Dune and someone told me this was fairly similar, also Sci-Fi.

### Lights Out: Pride, Delusion, And The Fall Of General Electric
This was on Bill Gates 2021 reading list, so decided to check it out.

### Operator Handbook: Red Team + OSINT + Blue Team by Netmux
Using this book as a basis for our blue team documentation for the WWU Cyber Defense team.

### Intrusion Detection Honeypots by Chris Sanders
This book relates heavily to my research on IDS honeypots at WWU. Expect a review of it soon.
